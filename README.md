 1. Influencing factors of the lowest price per square meter of <a href="https://www.wonzonecn.com/products/pir-sandwich-panel/"/>PIR sandwich panel</a> : fire protection grade of core material

 Polyurethane composite board is divided into three grades: B1, B2 and B3. The amount of black material is the key factor to determine the fire protection level of polyurethane composite board. The more the amount of black material used, the higher the fire protection grade of polyurethane composite board. On the contrary, the lower the fire protection level of polyurethane composite board is. The price of different fire prevention grades is also different. The higher the fire prevention grade, the higher the price.

 2. Influencing factors of the lowest price per square meter of PIR sandwich panel : upper and lower steel plates

 <a href="https://www.wonzonecn.com/"/>Wonzone</a> produced polyurethane sandwich panels using steel coils are color steel brand. Compared with market rolls, brand rolls have a longer service life and stronger endurance. PVDF coatings have a longer service life, so this is why our polyurethane sandwich panels are stacked outside without rusting. Polyurethane sandwich panel has two layers of steel plate. The price of upper and lower steel plate is affected by thickness, manufacturer, galvanized content and other factors. The higher the requirement of upper and lower steel plate, the higher the price will naturally be.
